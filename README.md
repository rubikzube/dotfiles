### Welcome
This is my dotfiles repo. It started out as a way of turning [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) into 
something that looked like [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and then ended up in a another 
place altogether.

### Installation
Instructions and Rake file started from https://github.com/craveytrain/dotfiles/

+ Clone the repo into your home directory
+ Enter the repo
+ Run rake

```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:rubikzube/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
rake
```
